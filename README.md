# Project Proposal

### Project title: Ceres System (Plant Monitor)

### What and why?
I'd like to build an independent plant monitoring app that communicates with hardware over a WiFi signal. This way, even someone with a completely black thumb can still manage to water their plants on a consistent basis. The app could measure fundamental things such as soil moisture, conductivity and humidity using simple hardware. This could also be used in automation projects as well.

### For whom?
Any person who cares deeply for their plants and wants to see them flourish would benefit from using a system such as this. Also, the person who is lazy and doesn't have much time to care for their plants could benefit from a notification letting them know their Begonia'a soil is at 10% moisture. Any gardener as well could see great return on investing in a dedicated monitoring system for their plants. Plant owners, farmers, anyone having anything to do with growing something in the ground could surely get some value out of a system such as this.

### How?
A user interface on a cell phone where people can see details about all their plants at a glance, and can drill down into individual members of the list for more intricate details and graphs. Ideally, the system would be elegant and simple. Adding plants would be as simple as hooking the sensor up to the WiFi network, naming the plant, and taking a picture for reference. With the software, we could even have users take pictures of their plants at different moisture levels and show them how their work is paying off to increase engagement. There are quite a few metrics available to the end consumer if they wish to use additional sensors. 

On a larger scale, an entire garden could be automated using a web interface, where users could add regions of different plants (an entire garden could be covered with just a few sensors, with pictures for reference of course). Adding them would be similar to adding a single household plant, and similar metrics would be available to them. There is the possibility of adding the ability to automate watering, however I feel like that should be a separate service entirely.

### Scope
The hardware itself is extremely manageable to program and build (and quite cheap, we could have a video tutorial upon first opening the app on how to build components with compatible code for them being distributed through our website, however this is just an idea). The entirety of the rest is data processing and display more or less, which should be manageable for a small team to work out.
